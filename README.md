# PigSkin-CNN

In this project, the training of a supervised learning algorithm for the classification of skin lesions was carried out. Some categories had few images as shown in the following figure:

</p>


therefore, the implementation of algorithms for the rotation of some images had to be carried out as shown in the following figure.

After data augmentation, it can be seen how the categories increase significantly.
